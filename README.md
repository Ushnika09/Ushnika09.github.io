# 🧹 Chorely — Your chores, cheerfully.

This is my simple **To-Do List** web app, which I built by customizing an existing project to learn about **Git version control** and **GitHub Pages** static site hosting.

---

## 📚 What I learned and did

- Took an existing To-Do List project as a starting point.  
- Practiced Git commands: cloning, committing, pushing changes.  
- Deployed the website for free on GitHub Pages.  
- Understood the full workflow from local development to live deployment.  
- Added **edit task functionality** and updated the **background** for a fresh look.

---

## ✨ Features

- Add new tasks, mark tasks complete, edit tasks inline, and delete tasks.  
- Updated background with a **fresh gradient + relevant image**.  
- Clean and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
